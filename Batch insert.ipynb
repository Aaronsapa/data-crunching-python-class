    "# Batch vs. Streamin Processing\n",
    "*[Source](https://thenewstack.io/the-big-data-debate-batch-processing-vs-streaming-processing/)*\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "- A batch is a collection of data points that have been grouped together within a specific time interval. Another term often used for this is a window of data. \n",
    "- Streaming processing deals with continuous data and is key to turning big data into fast data. Both models are valuable and each can be used to address different use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the batch processing model requires a set of data collected over time, streaming processing requires data to be fed into an analytics tool, and in real-time. Batch processing is often used when dealing with large volumes of data or data sources from legacy systems, where it’s not feasible to deliver data in streams. Batch data also by definition requires all the data needed for the batch to be loaded to some type of storage, a database or file system to then be processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data streams can also be involved in processing large quantities of data, but batch works best when you don’t need real-time analytics. \n"
